Against [Marcus](https://www.litcharts.com/lit/about-a-boy/characters/marcus-brewer)’s wishes, [Fiona](https://www.litcharts.com/lit/about-a-boy/characters/fiona-brewer-marcus-s-mum) informs the school’s headmistress, [Mrs. Morrison](https://www.litcharts.com/lit/about-a-boy/characters/headmistress-mrs-morrison), about the boys who stole his [trainers](https://www.litcharts.com/lit/about-a-boy/symbols/the-trainers), forcing Marcus to discuss the ordeal with her in person. While waiting outside her office, he is joined by [Ellie McCrae](https://www.litcharts.com/lit/about-a-boy/characters/ellie-mccrae), an infamous 10th grader who wears black lipstick and is constantly getting in trouble. Trying to be polite, Marcus says hello to Ellie. Although she doesn’t seem particularly enthused, she explains she’s in trouble for wearing a sweatshirt that doesn’t align with the dress code. The sweatshirt features a man who Marcus thinks “[looks] a little bit like Jesus, except more modern and with bleached hair.” Ellie tells him the man’s name is “[Kirk O’Bane](https://www.litcharts.com/lit/about-a-boy/symbols/kurt-cobain-nirvana),” a famous footballer, but Marcus notes that the man looks more like a musician than an athlete.

When [Mrs. Morrison](https://www.litcharts.com/lit/about-a-boy/characters/headmistress-mrs-morrison) suggests that [Marcus](https://www.litcharts.com/lit/about-a-boy/characters/marcus-brewer) hasn’t tried hard enough to “[keep] out of [the bullies’] way,” Marcus loses his temper and his patience, ultimately yelling at the headmistress. Despite her demands for Marcus to sit back down, he instead walks out of her office, a choice that surprises even Marcus. He decides to keep going and leaves the school altogether, labeling himself an official “truant” and wondering if all truants begin their truancy this way. Ultimately, though, Marcus doesn’t want to be the kind of person who ditches school; he just wants someone to understand him.

One of [Will](https://www.litcharts.com/lit/about-a-boy/characters/will-freeman)’s favorite pastimes is driving around London. He enjoys feeling like a “normal” person, dealing with traffic every day. He also loves blaring music and singing along as loudly as he can—especially [Nirvana](https://www.litcharts.com/lit/about-a-boy/symbols/kurt-cobain-nirvana), which he considers a “guilty pleasure.” Although Will doesn’t feel he can relate to the pain and the angst in their music, he screams along to it anyway, using this as a substitute for genuine feeling and emotion.

On one of these drives, [Will](https://www.litcharts.com/lit/about-a-boy/characters/will-freeman) sees [Marcus](https://www.litcharts.com/lit/about-a-boy/characters/marcus-brewer) wandering around town during school hours. Realizing the boy should be in school, Will feels conflicted. He knows the right thing to do would be to pull over and find out what happened or at least let [Fiona](https://www.litcharts.com/lit/about-a-boy/characters/fiona-brewer-marcus-s-mum) know that her son isn’t where he should be. However, he also recognizes that Marcus isn’t his responsibility, and frankly, he’d rather not get involved. By the time Marcus rings Will’s buzzer at exactly 4:15, Will has already resolved not to answer the door. As Marcus rings repeatedly, Will blasts [Nirvana](https://www.litcharts.com/lit/about-a-boy/symbols/kurt-cobain-nirvana)’s In Utero album on his speakers, hoping to drown out the obnoxious buzzer. Eventually, though, Marcus wears Will down, and he finally lets him inside.

Unfazed by [Will](https://www.litcharts.com/lit/about-a-boy/characters/will-freeman)’s hour-long avoidance tactic, [Marcus](https://www.litcharts.com/lit/about-a-boy/characters/marcus-brewer) promptly asks if Will will take him and a friend to see a soccer game to watch his favorite player, [Kirk O’Bane](https://www.litcharts.com/lit/about-a-boy/symbols/kurt-cobain-nirvana). Will, a sports fanatic, tells him no such player exists and switches the topic, attempting to get Marcus to confess that he skipped school. When Marcus doesn’t confess, Will confronts him and advises him to tell [his mum](https://www.litcharts.com/lit/about-a-boy/characters/fiona-brewer-marcus-s-mum) about what happened with [Mrs. Morrison](https://www.litcharts.com/lit/about-a-boy/characters/headmistress-mrs-morrison). Marcus wants Will to handle it instead, a request Will quickly shoots down. Finally revealing to Marcus that “Kirk O’Bane” is actually Kurt Cobain, it becomes clear to Will what kind of help Marcus really needs: he needs to learn to “be a kid, not an adult.”

19&20: analisis
This section demonstrates the clash between Marcus’s desire for autonomy and his mother’s protective actions. Fiona’s decision to inform the headmistress, despite Marcus’s wishes, underscores their ongoing struggle. Ellie’s nonconformity and trouble with the school’s dress code highlight different ways she intrigues Marcus, who admires her air of defiance. Marcus’s confusion about Kurt Cobain’s identity reflects his naivety and unfamiliarity with popular culture, emphasizing his youth and unique musical upbringing.

This paragraph reveals key aspects of Will’s character and coping mechanisms. Will enjoys driving around London and dealing with everyday traffic as a way to feel normal and escape his otherwise aimless lifestyle. His love for loudly singing along to Nirvana, despite not relating to the angst, shows his need for an emotional outlet. This behavior acts as a facade for genuine emotional expression, highlighting Will’s difficulty in confronting his true feelings. Nirvana, as his “guilty pleasure,” symbolizes the contrast between his external persona and internal struggles.

Will’s hesitation to check in on Marcus speaks to his reluctance to disrupt his responsibility-free lifestyle by taking accountability for the teenage boy. When Will is unable to drown out Marcus’s relentless doorbell ringing with Nirvana’s In Utero, he realizes, perhaps for the first time in the novel, that maintaining emotional distance is an impossible feat when the emotion itself is able to break through his numerous defenses, marking the beginning of Will’s reluctant acceptance of a more active role in Marcus’s life.
